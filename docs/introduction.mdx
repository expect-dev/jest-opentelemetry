Traceloop enables you to easily write and run end-to-end or integration tests for your microservice architecture.
It uses OpenTelemetry traces to learn how your system behaves in normal conditions and automatically generates assertions you
can use to validate any code you change.

Don't worry if you're not familiar with OpenTelemetry. Even if you don't have it currently in your system, you can easily set it up.

And we can help you too! Ping us at dev@traceloop.dev
