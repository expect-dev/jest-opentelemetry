title: "What if I don't have OpenTelemetry installed?"
---

No worries! You can install it in any existing Kubernetes environment in under 5 minutes by running the following set of commands.
**No code changes are needed**.

Feel free to contact us at dev@traceloop.dev if you need any help.

<Accordion title="Other options">
[Odigos](https://docs.odigos.io/intro) is a new open source project that can do this for you without a single line of code.

You can also find more ways to instrument OpenTelemetry on their [documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/js/getting-started/).

</Accordion>

1. Install cert-manager. This is required for the OpenTelemetry operator to work.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.11.0/cert-manager.yaml
   ```

2. Install the [OpenTelemetry operator](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/k8s-operator/) so that metrics will be generated and collected automatically.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-operator.yaml
   ```

3. Create a config file named `otel-collector.yaml` for your OpenTelemetry configurations:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Instrumentation
    metadata:
    name: otel-instrumentation
    spec:
    nodejs:
        image: traceloop/instrument-opentelemetry:node-0.3.0
    exporter:
        endpoint: http://otel-collector:4317
    propagators:
        - tracecontext
        - baggage
        - b3

   ---
   apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
   kind: OpenTelemetryCollector
   metadata:
   name: otel
   spec:
   config: |
     receivers:
       otlp:
           protocols:
             grpc:
             http:
     processors:
       batch:
           timeout: 100ms

     exporters:
       otlphttp:
           endpoint: http://host.docker.internal:4123

     service:
       pipelines:
           traces:
               receivers: [otlp]
               processors: [batch]
               exporters: [otlphttp]
   ```

   <Accordion title="What are we doing here?">

   We configure 2 separate things:

   1. The Instrumentation, which is an init-container which will run on any pod you explictly mark (see step 5).
      We are using our own init-container to get more data about your application (like the body of HTTP requests).
      You can always remove these lines to use the standard open telemetry init-container:

      ```yaml
      nodejs:
        image: traceloop/instrument-opentelemetry:node-0.3.0
      ```

   2. The OpenTelemetry collector, which will collect the metrics from the init-container and send them to the test runner.
      What's amazing here is that you can add other exporters to this config file to send the metrics to other services like Datadog and others.

   </Accordion>

4. Apply the config file:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f otel-collector.yaml
   ```

5. Update any service you want to instrument with the following annotations (Change the 2 occurances of `my-service` to the name of your service):

   <Note>
     We add an env var named `SERVICE_NAME` to your service so that you can
     later identify it in the tests.
   </Note>

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
   name: my-service
   spec:
   replicas: 1
   template:
     annotations:
       instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-nodejs: 'true'
   spec:
      containers:
          env:
            - name: SERVICE_NAME
              value: 'my-service'
   ```

   This will automatically instrument your service with OpenTelemetry and send the metrics to the OpenTelemetry collector.
   Apply those changes and you're done! You can start writing end to end tests.
