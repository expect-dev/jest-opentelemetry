title: 'Running Test Servers'
---

Currently, we have two test servers which are ran and tested together as part of Jest OpenTelemetry internal test suite:

- **orders-service** - a simple service that creates orders and send emails to users when an order is created.
- **emails-service** - a simple service that sends emails to users.

## Running locally

Running our test servers locally is as simple as running the following command:

```bash
   npm run start:test-servers
```

## Running on a local Kubernetes cluster

1. Make sure you have a K8s cluster running locally.
   If you don't, you can use either [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)
   or [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) to run a local cluster.

1. Build the docker image.

   ```bash
   npm run docker:test-servers
   ```

1. Install cert-manager (needed by OpenTelemetry operator)

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.11.0/cert-manager.yaml
   ```

1. Install the OpenTelemetry operator so that metrics will be generated and collected automatically.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-operator.yaml
   ```

1. Apply the K8s spec.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f packages/test-servers/deployment.yaml
   ```

   <Warning>
     If you ever re-built the docker image, make sure to delete the old
     deployment first. Run ```kubectl delete -f
     packages/test-servers/deployment.yaml ```
   </Warning>
