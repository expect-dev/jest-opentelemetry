title: 'Setting up a local developement environment'
---

Jest OpenTelemetry is using a monorepo (powered by [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/)).

Follow these instructions to set up a local developement environment.

1. Fork out repository and clone it locally.

   ```bash
   git clone <your fork path>
   cd jest-opentelemetry
   nvm install
   npm install
   ```

2. Build the packages:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Do any changes you want to do. Make sure to add proper tests, especially if you add new assertions.

4. Re-build the project (this is needed because the assertion package is using itself in the tests):

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. Run the [test servers](test-servers). You can either run them locally in a separate terminal or on a local Kubernetes cluster.
   These are the servers that we use to test the different assertions we have in Jest OpenTelemetry.

6. Run the tests to make sure everything still works:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

7. Commit, push and open a pull request.
