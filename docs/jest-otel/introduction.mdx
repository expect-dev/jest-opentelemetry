Jest OpenTelemetry is an engine for writing end to end tests for distributed systems with 10 lines of code.

```js
const sequence = await traces(async () => {
  await axios.post('http://orders-service/orders/create', {
    productId: 5,
    quantity: 2,
  });
});

expect(sequence.service('emails-service')).toReceiveHttpRequest({
  order: { productId: 5, quantity: 2 },
});
```

Everything is running locally on your system and can connect to services running locally on your machine,
or any kubernetes cluster (locally or remotely).

<Tip>
  We're working on a cloud runner that will enable you to run tests on large
  clusters with significant load. [Sign up for our private beta
