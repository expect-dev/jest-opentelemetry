title: 'GRPC Assertions'
---

Each assertion should start with defining the service you want to check. You do this by:

```js
expectTrace(traceloop.serviceByName('service-name'))...
```

These are the options you can use for service selection:

- `serviceByName` - the name of the service as reported in the `service.name` attribute
  (automatically reported by [Traceloop's init container](/jest-otel/no-otel))
- `serviceByK8sPodName` - the name of the pod as reported by Kubernetes
- `serviceByCustomAttribute` - any custom attribute reported by your service to OpenTelemetry

Following that, you can use any of the following assertions:

- `toSendGrpcRequest`
- `toReceiveGrpcRequest`

Then, you can specifically assert for each of the properties of the request:

- `withRpcMethod`
- `withRpcService`
- `withRpcGrpcStatusCode`
- `withNetPeerName`
- `withHostName`

So, a complete assertion can look like:

```js
expectTrace(traceloop.serviceByName('users-service'))
  .toReceiveGrpcRequest()
  .withRpcMethod('CreateUser')
  .withRpcGrpcStatusCode(0);
```
