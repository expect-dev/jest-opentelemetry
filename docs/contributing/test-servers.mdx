## Installing on a local Kubernetes cluster

1. Make sure you have a K8s cluster running locally.
   If you don't, you can use either [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)
   or [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) to run a local cluster.

1. Build the docker image.

   ```bash
   npm run docker:test-servers
   ```

1. Install cert-manager (needed by OpenTelemetry operator)

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.11.0/cert-manager.yaml
   ```

1. Install the OpenTelemetry operator so that metrics will be generated and collected automatically.

   ```bash
       kubectl apply -f https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-operator.yaml
   ```

1. Apply the K8s spec.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f packages/test-servers/deployment.yaml
   ```

   <Info>
     If you ever re-built the docker image, you need to delete the old
     deployment first. ```bash kubectl delete -f
     packages/test-servers/deployment.yaml ```
   </Info>
